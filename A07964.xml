            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3016:15"/>your following Arguments will but reſemble (to vſe the words of an Apoſtle <hi>(Epiſt. of Iude) Clowdes without water, caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with wynds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therfore I would intreate, for the better tryall of your Arguments, and how they do beate vpon the difficulty here queſtioned, rightly to conceaue what we Catholiks meane, when we ſay, <hi>The B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin did want Originall ſinne:</hi> Since for the more clearing of this point, it is to be vnderſtood, that the <hi>Sinne</hi> of the firſt Parent is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with his Sonnes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, three ſeuerall wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt then the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are ſaid to haue ſinned in Adam himſelfe, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> did tranſgreſſe the precept of God in Paradiſe. And becauſe the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> were not then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3016:16"/>
                  <hi>in actu,</hi> but only <hi>in potentia;</hi> therefore that <hi>Sinne</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted not <hi>in actu,</hi> but only <hi>in potentia.</hi> And in this ſenſe we confeſſe, it may be ſaid, that the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> ſinned in Adam.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all the children <hi>of Adam</hi> are ſaid to be conceaued in ſinne, as ſoone as the Child begins to exiſt in the wombe of the Mother, although it be then vnformed &amp; without life; for although ſinne cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be otherwiſe, then in a Rationall Soule, and that the <hi>Foetus</hi> begins to be conformed and perfected a long tyme after its animation: yet be cauſe a man then beginneth truly to exiſt in reſpect of one of his parts, and that Part hath its beginning from a corrupt Nature, &amp; may be ſaid to be truly vitiated, and this by force of its generation;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3016:16"/>aſſoone therefore as it hath obtayned its <hi>Rationall Soule,</hi> he preſently doth exiſt a ſinner, and a ſonne of diuine Wrath: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are men ſaid in this reſpect, euen then at the firſt, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in Iniquities, according to thoſe former Words of the Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.) <hi>Ecce in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatibus conceptus ſum &amp;c.</hi> be hould I am conceaued in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. And in this ſecond ſenſe alſo we acknowledge, that the B. Virgin had her beginning from a corrupt nature, and that by force of ſuch generation, it was due, that ſinne ſhould be contracted, as ſoone as her Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſoule was ioyned to Her Body.</p>
               <p>The third, and laſt manner, whereby men are ſaid to be conceaued in ſinne, is, when their Soules are inſpired into their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3016:17"/>Bodies; ſince at that time they begin properly, and really to become Men, and to haue their Will naked of Originall Iuſtice, and conſequently auerted from God, and in it ſelfe deformed, Now, touching this third and laſt kind (vpon the hinge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the may ne difficulty, contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted betweene the learned, chiefly reſteth) we hould it moſt probable (though as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intimated, not as a matter of Fayth) that the ſoule of the B. Virgin, euen at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of its Creation, and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the Body, was ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot of Originall ſinne, as that that perſon of hers actually exiſting, neuer had any ſinne. And in this reſpect the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> differeth from all others, who through the Grace of God, and merits of Chriſts Paſſion, haue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3016:17"/>beene deliuered from <hi>Originall ſinne:</hi> To wit, that ſome men are deliuered from thence after their Natiuity; ſome few a litle before their Natiuity, but after their amination in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wombe: Whereas the B. Virgin was freed from Originall ſinne, euen in the very inſtant of her Animation.</p>
               <p>Now (<hi>Mariamastix</hi>) you are to direct your Arguments, only againſt this third manner, or els you euict nothing. And if you do otherwiſe, where then is your Enemy, againſt whom you fight?</p>

               <p>Well, ſeing it is ſo, I will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your deſire, and am content for the tyme to yield to your impoſed method. I will produce my Arguments in a graduall manner; Firſt beginning with Arguments drawne from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Next from the Fathers (ſo ſhall your owne Friend, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wound your owne Cauſe) and laſtly I will aſcend to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, taken from Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ.</p>
               <p>And to begin with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Reaſon. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3016:20"/>obiect, that <hi>Mary</hi> ſuffered many miſeries and euen death it ſelfe, all which are the puniſhments of ſinne. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſeemeth moſt detractory from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, if the priuiledge of <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> ſhould be giuen to any other, then to Chriſt himſelfe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Mary was neuertruly redeemed, if ſhe was neuer captiue to ſinne. <hi>Fourtly,</hi> ſhe was conceaued with the luſt, or ſenſuality of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: but this laſt is the Meanes or Inſtrument, by the which <hi>Originall ſinne</hi> is tranſiected, or transfuſed into the of ſpring. In this laſt place I add, that Chriſt dyed for All; and yet he dyed not for the luſt, but only for ſinners; Therefore dying (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) for his Mother, it followeth, ſhe was conceaued in ſinne: ſo euident, we ſee <hi>(Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus)</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:3016:20"/>this Concluſion of myne is, as that it is proued with a whole teame or chayne of moſt forcing Reaſons, one of them ſtill following, or wayting vpon another.</p>

I anſwere, that the ſoule of the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin</hi> was preſerued from all ſpot of ſinne; Yet I grant, that her fleſh was not redeemed, till after her death (through the particular Grace of God) ſhe did riſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond. I maintayne, that the Immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin</hi> cannot bring any diſhonour to the glory of the ſonne of God, but rather the contrary: Seing it is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar honour of the Sonne of God, that being conceaued of the Holy Ghoſt, could not through force of his generation contract ſinne. It further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth to the glory of the ſonne of God, if not only thoſe can be iuſtifyed by his merits who had ſinne, but alſo that ſome one might be preſerued from ſinne, who otherwiſe, would neceſſarily haue fallen into ſinne.</p>
               <p>Your third Reaſon is but weake, ſeing (as is explayned) thoſe are truly redeemed, who had neceſſarily become captiue to ſinne, had not the interue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the fauour &amp; Grace of the Redeemer preuented them.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:3016:21"/>
               <p>To your fourth, it taketh its full ſolution, from what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue deliuered: for I grant the luſt of the Parents is a ſigne of Nature being corrupted; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from Nature corrupted the fleſh is conceaued, as naturally vitiated; yet from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, but that God is able, when he conioyneth the rationall ſoule with the fleſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, with all to infuſe Grace of Iuſtification; by the which, the ſpot or blemiſh of ſinne may wholy be driuen, and taken away.</p>
               <p>To your laſt, I ſay, Chriſt died for all ſinners, who either then were ſinners, or neceſſarily would haue beene ſinners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the death of the ſaid Chriſt had defended them from ſinne, through his wonderfull Grace and fauour.</p>

               <p>We ſee you are full of froa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy oſtentation. But to your Arguments. We do not deny, but that the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> was dead in <hi>Adam:</hi> Therefore we grant, that by Nature, ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Wrath:</hi> But we alſo adde, that throug Grace, ſhe euer was the daughter of <hi>Mercy:</hi> For it pleaſed God in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3016:26"/>the benedictions of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo to preuent her, that ſhe neuer was a ſinner, which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> required; but that ſhe was euer Iuſt, which <hi>Grace</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre.</p>
               <p>And according hereto we confeſſe, that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> (who then was not) did ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> after that ſort, which ſhe could; I meane, <hi>in potentia</hi> only, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect wherof ſhe ſtood obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious, that when ſhe really did exiſt, ſhe might, <hi>reipſa,</hi> haue had ſinne in her: Yet withall we add, that ſhe was ſo preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted throgh the ſingular Grace and Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, that all at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſhe ſhould begin to <hi>be,</hi> and withall to <hi>be Iuſt.</hi> Thus you may obſerue, that the true bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing and application of my former Annotations do euen at the firſt ſight, blunt the force of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3016:26"/>your three ſcripturall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But proceed further.</p>

               <p>What ſay you to thoſe other Words of the Apoſtle (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) <hi>Si vnus pro omnibus mortuus est, ergo omnes mortui ſunt, &amp; pro om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus mortuus eſt Christus: Yf one be dead for all, then were all dead; and Christ dyed for all?</hi>

               <p>We freely grant, that the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> after a manner was dead, through the death of ſinne; And ſo, as it is alſo true, that <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for her Viuification, as he dyed for others. But withall we maintayne, that the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> is ſaid to be dead, becauſe ſhe ſtood ſubject to death, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily (as aboue is often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated) was to dye, by force of her generation, except ſhe had beene preuented therin by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3016:27"/>the Grace of God. And thus much touching the ſolutions of your Textes of Scripture. But now to reflect a litle vpon your former windy Words: How is our Cauſe by theſe your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Gods Word (as you vaunte) become proſtrate with the ground? or where are your Demonſtrations taken from Scripture, as you ambitiouſly ſtile then?

And if ſuch men yield not to the Truth therein, it is to be feared, they are intereſted in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is

               <p>I am well pleaſed, For this alternation, and viciſſitude of Oppoſing and Anſwering, is moſt reaſonable in it ſelfe, and moſt warrantable by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all Schooles. Therefore begin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mariadulus.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, I will tread your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3016:28"/>owne path of Methode; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with arguments drawne from Reaſon. And after I will aſcend to higher kinds of proofes. My firſt Reaſon ſhalbe this. It is certaine and explorate, that God could preſerue the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> from contagion of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Sinne: And it is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he would do it: And therefore it is probable, that ſhe was preſerued from all ſuch contagion. That God could preſerue her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Originall Sinne,</hi> cannot be denyed, ſeeing that there is no repugnancy therein either in reſpect of God, or in reſpect of her, as being a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Not in reſpect of God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is Omnipotent, and we read <hi>(Luc. 1.) Non est impoſſibile apud Deum omne Verbum.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any repugnancy with reference to the Creature,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3016:28"/>ſeing there is no hinderance or contradiction, why euen in the ſame moment of tyme, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſoule might not be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and withall reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Grace. Which point we belieue was actually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Creation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of the ſoule of the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, much more in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule of Chriſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mariamastix.</speaker>
               <p>I grant indeed: It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the abſolute Power or Will of God, to preſerue any from <hi>Originall ſinne;</hi> Yet it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, once admitting that diuine and immutable Decree, by the which God hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if Adam had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all men ſhould haue beene conceaued, being indued with Originall Iuſtice: but if <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne, then they ſhould be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3016:29"/>conceaued in wickednes, and ſhould by Nature become the <hi>Sonnes of Wrath.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mariadulus.</speaker>
               <p>This your Anſwere is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. The Reaſon being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that diuine decree is ſo to be vnderſtood, as that if Adam ſhould haue ſinned, all men, who did take their origen from him, through force of their Conception, ſhould ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to ſinne; neither ſhould they haue any title to that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the which they had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their firſt Parent; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it followeth not, that through force of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, God ſhould de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that power, but that he might out of his owne Mercy and ſingular Priuiledge really preſerue any one from ſinne: For not only <hi>Sinne,</hi> but alſo <hi>death,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:3016:29"/>did redound from Adam into all Mankind; &amp; yet who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but that God could make, and effect, that ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man ſhould not dye at all?</p>
               <p>Thus much in ſolution of your former Reply. Now from the Premiſſes we may gather, that it was in the power of God, to preſerue the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> free from all ſinne and to make her holy, and iuſt in the firſt inſtant of her Creation. And that God actually would ſo preſerue her, it may be made probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrable from thoſe Reaſons, by which S. Thomas <hi>in 3 part. quaeſt.</hi> 27. <hi>Artic.</hi> 4.) proueth, that it was conuenient and beſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that the mother of God ſhould be free from all actuall ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons are ſeuerall, and theſe following.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:3016:30"/>
               <p>The 1. Reaſon is, becauſe as well the Honour, as the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of the Mother redoundeth to the ſonne.</p>
               <p>The ſecond. In that the ſonne of God (who is the Wiſdome of the Father) did (as it were) inhabitate in the wombe of the Mother, after a moſt peculiar and wonderfull manner; but it is ſaid in holy Scripture: <hi>In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolam animam &amp;c. Wiſdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into a wicked hart, nor dwell in the body, that is ſubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct vnto ſinne.</hi> (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon. Becauſe the Mother of Chriſt hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affinity and coniunction with Chriſt himſelfe. But what agreement can be betwene Chriſt and Belial?</p>
               <p>The fourth. Becauſe that te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Heauenly Spouſe ought to be accompliſhed and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3016:30"/>fulfilled in the B. Virgin, <hi>Tota pulchra est amica mea, &amp; macula non eſt in te. Thou art all fayre (my loue) and there is not any ſpot in thee.</hi> (<hi>Cant.</hi> 4.)</p>
               <p>The fifth. Seing God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to aduance the B Virgin to ſo ſupreme dignity, that ſhe ſhould excell euen the Angells themſelues; therefore it was moſt ſutable and agreable, that no priuiledge ſhould be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon any pure Creature, which was not conferred vpon the B. Virgin; except ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge were repugnant to the Condition, ſtate, Nature or Sex. But to be ſanctifyed in the firſt inſtant of Creation was giuen to our firſt Parents; As alſo to be ſanctified in the firſt inſtant of Creation, and neuer to be polluted with any ſinne, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the holy Angells: But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3016:31"/>this priuiledge is in no ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant either to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtate, Nature, or Sex of the <hi>B Virgin:</hi> Therefore it is a pious thing to belieue, that the Mother of God did not want this Priuiledge.</p>
               <p>Truly theſe former Reaſons do no leſſe proue, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God ought to be free from actuall ſinne, then (if ſo it could be effected) from <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall ſinne:</hi> yea more from <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne,</hi> then from actuall Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinne; ſeing <hi>Originall ſinne</hi> doth more defile the ſoule, and ſubiecteth both the body and ſoule to ſinne, then Veniall ſinne can do. Thus much of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, probably prouing the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception</hi> of the holy Mother of God.</p>

               <p>To ſhape my anſwere, firſt, to the firſt Part of this your ſhort Paragraph; I ſay, we proue from the former Scriptures the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, and pious iudgment only of the <hi>Immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the B.

                  </hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> of what they do proue; this your refuge croſſeth mainly the proceeding of God, who would haue the Old Teſtament to adumbrate and point out diuers things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the tyme of the New Teſtament: So deſeruedly and with iuſt cauſe, did the Apoſtle leaue written thoſe words for our inſtruction: <hi>Omnia in figura contingebant illis.</hi> (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.)</p>
               <p>Now touching the ſecond branche of your Reply; I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, You receaue it from the pen of <hi>Kempnitius</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 520.) that rigid, and cenſuring <hi>Aristarchus</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo ready ſome of you Proteſtants are, to licke vp the poyſon, which others of your Brethren

Anſelme</hi> (<hi>in Comment. c.</hi> 5. <hi>poster. ad Corinth.</hi>) which Father was more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then <hi>Peter Lombard.</hi> A point ſo euident, that <hi>Kempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> himſelfe (ſome two pages
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3016:40"/>after the place aboue cited) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth this very Opinion <hi>to S.

               <p>Now touching the <hi>Command</hi> or Precept of the Councell of Trent, and the <hi>Conſtitution of Sixtus the fourth,</hi> what a mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious and ſhameles forehead hath <hi>Kempnitius</hi> in forcing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3016:40"/>written Word of God. And thus far now of our Diſpute concerning the Conception of her, who was ſuperiour to the Angells in <hi>Grace,</hi> though infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in <hi>Nature:</hi> Only I will conclude, that it was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the dignity of the holy Virgin, that ſhe, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued her Sonne aboue the courſe of Nature, herſelfe alſo ſhould be conceaued aboue the Courſe of Nature.

               <p>But to proceed ſomewhat further. Yſ the former Sentences and prayers directed to the B.

I do accomplish thoſe things, which do want in the Paſſion of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in my flesh, for his body, which is the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope, you are not here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the Apoſtle thoght the Paſſion of Chriſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, without his owne ſufferings; for his meaning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, that as Chriſt the Head, and Members, his Body, make one <hi>Perſon Mysticall,</hi> the Church in this reſpect, being his Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. Fulneſſe, or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.: ſo the Paſſions of the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afflictions of the body, and members, make
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3016:49"/>one complete maſſe of Paſſions. Thus there is no want of Chriſts Paſſion, as he ſuffered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as Head; but there is want in thoſe Paſſions of Chriſt, which he daily ſuffereth in his Body, the Church, and in the members thereof.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>(Mariamastix)</hi> ſince theſe two former Texts of Saint Paul ſeeme in an ignorant eye, more derogatory vnto our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and his Paſſion, then thoſe ſentences by you vrged, &amp; practiſed by Catholiks; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Texts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, are to be conſtrued in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſe, and ſo are moſt true: Therefore I could wiſh you not ſo earneſtly to quarrell at the Paſſages by you alledged; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke to diſueſt them of that pious ſenſe and meaning, which is euer intended by vs

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part, to wit, <hi>Benedictus ſru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus ventris tui,</hi> are the Words of S. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> when ſhe came to viſit her; all which is recorded by the holy Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt (<hi>Luc.</hi> 1.) The laſt Part, that is, <hi>Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis &amp;c.</hi> is the Additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church to the two former paſſages. Now what
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3016:74"/>hurt or danger is there in ſaying this ſalutation? Since it imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in vs a continuall, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull Memory of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Myſtery, of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>Touching the often repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; in reprehending whereof, you idly beate the ayre. For if our Sauiour praying in the Garden, did repeate one and the ſame Prayer, thryce, to wit, <hi>Pater, ſipoſſibile est, tranſeat à me calix iste: Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſſe from me:</hi> Of which Point the Euangeliſt ſayth, (<hi>Math.</hi> 26.) <hi>Orauit tertiò, cundem ſermonem dicens; He prayed the third tyme, ſaying the ſame Words:</hi> Yf our Sauiour (I ſay) repeated the ſame Prayer thrice; Why may we not repeate the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> ſeuerall times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperſtition? Againe, if it be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3016:75"/>lawfull to repeate once a day, the <hi>Pater noster qui es in caelis &amp;c.</hi> why may we not iterate twice or thrice a day the ſame Prayer? And if ſo often, why then not ſo many ſcores of tymes, as we will? And the like may be ſaid of the often repetition of the <hi>Aue Maria;</hi> ſeeing no reaſon, can be giuen for the reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the number, in ſaying of either of them.</p>
               <p>But to proceed further. The <hi>Roſary</hi> (mentioned by you) is alſo called the <hi>Pſalter of the B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin.</hi> It conſiſteth of fifteene <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and one hundred &amp; <hi>Fifty Aues.</hi> It was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> to extinguiſh the Hereſy of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> The number of the <hi>Aues,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented after the manner of the <hi>Pſalter of Dauid,</hi> which contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and hundred &amp; fifty Pſalms;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3016:75"/>as the <hi>Roſary</hi> contayneth fifteen <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and an hundred &amp; fifty <hi>Aue Maria's.</hi> You are to know further <hi>(Mariamaſtix)</hi> that there be fifteene Miſteries of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> touching the Incarnation, the Paſſion, and what paſſed after the Paſſion; And that in the contemplation or meditation of euery one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in particular, one <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and ten <hi>Aues</hi> are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. The firſt fyue of theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are called, <hi>Ioyfull,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fiue, <hi>Dolorous,</hi> the laſt fiue, <hi>Glorious</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Corone,</hi> in like ſort ſpecified by you: it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of ſix <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and threeſcore, and three <hi>Aue's.</hi> Which number of 63. is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the Church doth hould, that the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> did liue,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3016:76"/>till ſhe was threeſcore and three yeares of age. Now this deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being peculiarly directed to the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> ſo many <hi>Aue's</hi> are recited, as ſhe liued yeares. And thus far touching the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> and the <hi>Corone</hi> of our Lady.</p>
               <p>Now that the number of the <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and the <hi>Aues</hi> both in the <hi>Roſary</hi> and the <hi>Corone,</hi> is reckoned by help of Beads; this is only to eaſe and help our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in performing the due number. Neither is the vſe of praying vpon litle ſtones (which is all one, as vpon Beads) lately ſprung vp; for it is moſt ancient (and therein warrantable) as appeareth from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the <hi>Centuriſts Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>col.</hi> 1329. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Yea <hi>Zozomenus</hi> recordeth of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> the famous Monke who

Euery day he (Paul) payed to God (as it were a certaine tribute) three hundred prayers: And to preuent, that he might not erre in the number, he tooke into his boſome three hundred litle stones: and at the ſaying of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayer, he did cast from him a litle stone; And then he ſeeing all his stones to be ſpent, and cast away from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was aſſured, that he had performed ſo many Prayers as were in number anſwerable to the stones.</hi> Thus <hi>Zozomene</hi> reporteth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3016:77"/>of the daily practiſe of <hi>S.

               <p>Well, this your ſuperſtitious deuotion conſiſting in a fruitles <hi>Battalogy</hi> and iteration (ſo many ſcores of tymes) of the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angell, might be more pardonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſo this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, or Prayer of the <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> did carry any peculiar Honour to <hi>Mary,</hi> which were not communicable to diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3016:78"/>But ſeeing (as I partly touched in my late <hi>Sermon</hi>) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is therein contayned by priuiledge to Her, but it (and perhaps more) is found to be giuen in the Holy Scriptures to others; I therefore ſee the leſſe reaſon, why you Papiſts ſhould ſo much pryze (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo often repeate) the ſame.</p>
               <p>And therefore to cut vp (as it were) and <hi>anatomize</hi> euery part and member thereof: And firſt to begin with the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,</hi> who was ſent to <hi>Mary;</hi> We read, that <hi>Angells</hi> were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſent to others, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in matters ſeeming of no great importance: Thus for example (to omit many other ſuch paſſages for breuity) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi> were ſent to <hi>Abraham</hi> (<hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 18.) as alſo to <hi>Tobias</hi> the yonger (<hi>Tob.</hi> 12.) and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3016:78"/>with him diuers dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather. In like ſort <hi>S. Iohn the Euangeliſt</hi> ſaw an <hi>Angell</hi> ſtanding by him before the Altar (<hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. c.</hi> 8.) What great, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary priuiledge then did <hi>Mary</hi> enioy by hauing an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell</hi> ſent to her? Now to deſcend to the words of the ſalutation: And firſt touching the Word, <hi>Aue, Hayle,</hi> vſed by the <hi>Angell</hi> to <hi>Mary;</hi> I do fynd little reſpect or reuerence, giuen to her by this Word. For do we not read, that the Iewes euen with ſcorne and contempt, ſaid to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Aue, Rex Iudeorum?</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> 19.) <hi>All Hayle, O king of the Iewes?</hi> And did not <hi>Iudas</hi> the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, ſalute Chriſt, at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of him, by the word, <hi>Aue Rabbi?</hi> (<hi>Math.</hi> 26.) Thus you ſee, that the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vſed by this word, <hi>Aue,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3016:79"/>carieth with it diſgrace and contempt: ſo far was <hi>Mary</hi> from being much honored by this Word, vſed by the <hi>Angell.</hi>

               <p>Before you proceed further <hi>(Mariamastix)</hi> in this your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Comment (for I can call it no better) let me intreat you to pauſe a litle. I ſee, you inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſpread your ſelfe much therein; My memory is but weake, and if I ſhould ſuffer you to giue the reines to your ſelfe in this your diſcourſe, before the laſt part were ended, I ſhould forget, what the beginning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was. Therefore you muſt giue me leaue to reply, to what you haue allready diſgorged. And firſt, touching the <hi>Angell,</hi> being ſent to our <hi>Bleſsed Lady;</hi> I do grant, that <hi>Angells</hi> were in like manner ſent to others by <hi>God:</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:3016:79"/>yet the difference betweene the ſeuerall manners of ſending was great, in two reſpects. Firſt in the <hi>Perſon,</hi> who was ſent; Secondly, in the <hi>Embaſſage.</hi> The <hi>Perſon</hi> ſent, was <hi>Gabriel</hi> the ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, among many thouſands of <hi>Angells;</hi> And you know, that euen among terrene Princes, the greater that the Noble Man is, who is ſent as Embaſſadour, the greater Honour is thereby giuen to the other Prince, to whom he is ſent.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Embaſſage,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the <hi>Angell Gabriel</hi> was ſent to the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin;</hi> It was of the greateſt conſequence and moment, that can be imagined: To wit, <hi>the Natiuity of him, who after was to redeeme the World.</hi> Now, to parallell theſe two Points, with that by you alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Thoſe <hi>Angells</hi> by you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3016:80"/>(though euery <hi>Angell</hi> be almoſt of infinite dignity) were of an inferiour degree to the <hi>Angell Gabriel,</hi> as well may be ſuppoſed. And the buſines or imployments, about wh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h they were ſent to Men, was infinitly of a leſſer weight, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then the <hi>Redemption of Mankind.</hi> Thus you ſee <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamastix)</hi> the more you ſeeke to depreſſe the Honour exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Mother of <hi>Christ</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the more indeed by a true ballancing of the compariſon here made, her Honour is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now, you muſt further know hereby, that among the diuers functions or offices of the <hi>Angells,</hi> one (and that the greateſt) is, that they are ſent, as <hi>Gods</hi> Legates, to ſignify thoſe things, which <hi>God</hi> will haue to be ſignified to Men, eſpecially
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3016:80"/>touching the buſines of <hi>Mans Redemption,</hi> and eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The truth of which point the Apoſtle conteſteth in theſe Words: <hi>Nonne omnes (Angeli) ſunt administratorij Spiritus &amp;c. Are they not all (vz. the Angels) ministring ſpirits, ſent to minister for them, who shall receaue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of ſaluation? (Hebr. c. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the manner of the ſalutation of the <hi>Angell,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the word <hi>Aue;</hi> I grant, that the ſame Word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by you in your former Examples, was vſed by way of ſcorne, and treacherous intent. But what proueth this? Doth the abuſe either of Words or things, take away or diminiſh the worth of the true vſe of them? Nothing leſſe. For then it ſhould follow, that it were no Honour to the Creatour of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3016:81"/>all things, to be called, <hi>Deus;</hi> ſince this Word is not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Men, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Ego dixi, Dij estis: I haue ſaid, you are Gods, (Pſal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 95) Thus we gather from hence, that the abuſe of the word <hi>Aue,</hi> doth not leſſen the worth of the <hi>Angells</hi> Salutation by that Word. But I pray you, proceed further in this your intended <hi>Paraphraze</hi> of the <hi>Aue Maria.</hi> For hitherto you haue brought nothing, but what is triuiall, and vnworthy the eares of the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

               <p>I ſee, you euer diſualew and ſleight all my arguments; yet (I truſt) the Euent will proue of what force that is which I ſhall now alledge. Heere then I ſay, that admitting for a tyme, your Conſtruction of the former
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3016:83"/>Greeke word were true, and that <hi>Mary</hi> were <hi>full of Grace;</hi> yet this priuiledge of <hi>Grace</hi> is imparted to diuers others, and not to her alone. Therefore no peculiar Honour arriſeth to her therby. According to this my aſſertion, we read, that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> were <hi>replenished with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (<hi>Luc.</hi> 1.) As alſo the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.) <hi>S.

Thus we ſee, that no <hi>Encomion,</hi> or Laud is giuen to <hi>Mary</hi> by the words, <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> which is not attributed to all theſe here alledged, yea in a more full man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſince theſe were <hi>Pleni Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ſancto</hi> (as is ſaid) and <hi>Mary</hi> was full but of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is

               <p>It is ſtrange, to ſee how you rack your wits againſt the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate Mother of God. But to theſe your Examples I anſwere, That to thoſe, who reſt more in the ſound of the words, then in the vſe of the phraze of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it may ſeeme (I grant) a greater matter to be <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> then to be <hi>full of Grace:</hi> But the cuſtome of the Scripture impugneth this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite: for ſince it teacheth, that many were <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and but moſt few were full <hi>of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it euidently ſheweth, that this later, to wit, to be <hi>full of Grace,</hi> is ſo much of greater worth, as falling out but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3016:84"/>then the former, I meane to be full <hi>of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as falling out more often. I meane not hereby, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (which is the fountayne, and authour of <hi>Grace</hi>) ſhould be of leſſer dignity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Grace it ſelfe; but my meaning is, that thoſe, who are ſaid to be repleniſhed with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be full of the ſpirit of the Holy Ghoſt, in reſpect only of ſome particular guift of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in them, as in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally working of Miracles, or in ſome other ſuch ſtrange, and vnaccuſtomed particular thing.

Here I ſay, that theſe words, <hi>Dominas tecum,</hi> import no more, but that the <hi>Angell</hi> prayed, that the Lord might be with <hi>Mary;</hi> Which I proue to be true, ſince the very ſame Words are vſed in the ſame ſenſe euen by <hi>Angells</hi> to Men (<hi>Judic. c.</hi> 8.) as alſo by Men to other Men (<hi>Ruth.</hi> 2.) In like ſort, thoſe other Words following, vz. <hi>Benedicta tis in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieribus,</hi> are to be interpreted, to be a Prayer of the <hi>Angell,</hi> that <hi>Mary may be bleſſed.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, this benediction of the

                  <hi>Angell</hi> is not to beare compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the bleſſednes of <hi>Men</hi> (which may be thought to be greater) but only of <hi>Women;</hi> and ſo accordingly it is reſtrayned by thoſe words, <hi>in mulicribus.</hi> Now in either of theſe ſhort clauſes, where is <hi>Mary</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily honored by the <hi>Angell,</hi> ſince the <hi>Angells</hi> pray for men in generall?</p>

               <p>It ſeemes <hi>(Mariamaſtix)</hi> you will euer be <hi>your ſelfe;</hi> I meane, you will euer continue in your deplorable Malignity, againſt the Mother of the Redeemer of the World. To come to your Obiections, Firſt, touching the words, <hi>Dominus tecum;</hi> they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify not a precation, or prayer (as you ſurmize they do) but an abſolute Enunciation, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Angell,</hi> that our Lord
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3016:87"/>is already with the Virgin; For it is not to be doubted, but that theſe Words, <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> are an explication of the former Words, <hi>Gratia plena:</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the Sentences are to be vnderſtood after one and the ſame manner; To wit, that ſeing the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin</hi> was full <hi>of Grace,</hi> in that ſhe was repleniſhed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Guifts; that conſequently our <hi>Lord was with her,</hi> and did ſpiritually inhabit in her. And accordingly S. <hi>Austin</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the words, <hi>Dominus tecum</hi> ſaying, (<hi>Serm. de tempore</hi> 18.) <hi>It est Dominus tecum &amp;c. Our Lord is ſo with thee (O Mary) as that he is in thy hart, in thy wombe; He doth replenish thy ſoule, replenish thy flesh:</hi> And conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly hereto all the Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue alledged, touching our former interpretation, of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3016:88"/>Words <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> do agree.</p>
               <p>To deſcend to thoſe other Words of the <hi>Angell, Benedicta tu in mulieribus,</hi> and to your <hi>Scholia</hi> giuen of them; I affirme firſt, that theſe Words do not import only a <hi>Prayer,</hi> but a <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Aſſertion,</hi> for the <hi>Angell</hi> doth not pray, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin</hi> ſhould be bleſſed of God; but doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce and affirme, that ſhe is already bleſſed. My reaſon hereof is this: In that ſhe could not wiſh for any greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>God,</hi> then that ſhe ſhould be <hi>full of Grace;</hi> but at that very inſtant ſhe was <hi>full of Grace,</hi> as aboue is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Furthermore, the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth euen from the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the words of the <hi>Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> For ſince, theſe ſeuerall ſhort paſſages, <hi>Gratia plena, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus tecum, benedicta tu in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieribus,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:3016:88"/>are in one, and the ſame period of Scripture, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the ſame Tenour; they ought therefore to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted after one and the ſame manner. But the two former Paſſages, to wit, <hi>Gratia plena,</hi> and <hi>Dominus tecum</hi> (as we haue ſhewed I do contayne a poſitiue Annunciation or Affirmation, and not a Precation, or Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Wiſhing. Therefore we may irrepliably conclude, that this third Paſſage alſo, vz. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta tu in mulieribus,</hi> ought to be interpreted in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after the two firſt Clauſes.</p>
               <p>Now to that, where you ſay, that the Benediction here aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> is reſtrayned only to the degree and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Benediction giuen to <hi>Women,</hi> and not to <hi>Men;</hi> ſince we read, <hi>in mulieribus,</hi> that is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3016:89"/>
                  <hi>inter mulieres,</hi> and not, <hi>in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> and therefore ought not to be of that weight and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with that benediction, which is giuen to <hi>Men:</hi> To this I anſwere, that ſince our <hi>B. Lady</hi> is a Woman, and not a Man, therefore the Compariſon of the Benediction ought to be only of thoſe, who are of the ſame Sex, or kind. Thus much <hi>(Mariamastix)</hi> touching your Paraphrazing, and our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like illuſtration of the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Angell</hi> to the Bleſſed Virgin.

                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:3016:89"/>euen with this one vnanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and choaking Argument. It is taken from <hi>Christ</hi> his owne Words, and it is this. Yf <hi>Mary</hi> be not bleſſed at all, how then can your former interpretation (by which you ſo much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her) be true? That ſhe was not bleſſed, <hi>Caluin,</hi> my May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>(in his Harmonia)</hi> and I do thus proue. You know, we read, that a certaine <hi>Woman,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. ſaying to <hi>Christ, Beatus venter qui te portauit &amp;c. Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that thou didst ſucke; Christ</hi> anſwered (or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) her in theſe words: <hi>Quinimo beati, qui audiunt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei, &amp; custodiunt illud: Yea rather, Bleſſed be they who heare th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3016:90"/>(to wit, that ſhe was bleſſed who bore <hi>Christ</hi>) which the <hi>Woman</hi> afore did ſpeake; and did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that, which was not ſaid; Which is as much, as to ſay, that <hi>Christ denied Mary to be bleſsed,</hi> and did reſtrayne bleſſednes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, who heare and keep the Word of God.

O ſerpentine
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3016:90"/>and almoſt vnpardonable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice! But to your Reaſon, which you vauntingly call your <hi>Aries;</hi> I grant, that <hi>Caluin</hi> (your Idol) argueth according to your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod herein. But let <hi>Caluin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (but ô! now it is to late, ſince his poore ſoule remaynes in euerlaſting paynes) and you repent alſo of theſe your both plaſphemous ſpeaches. Take notice then, that our <hi>Sauiours Words</hi> in his former Anſwere to the <hi>Woman,</hi> imports thus much; <hi>Yea rather:</hi> But who ſayth, <hi>Yea rather,</hi> is preſumed to affirme both that, which is ſaid, and that which is to be ſaid; But withall preferreth that to be ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, which is already ſaid.</p>
               <p>For example, if one ſaying, This is a fayre <hi>Saphyre,</hi> you ſhould anſwere, yea it is rather a fayre <hi>Diamond;</hi> you do not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3016:91"/>deny it to be a <hi>Saphyre,</hi> though withall your Words implye, that a <hi>Diamond</hi> is a richer ſtone then a <hi>Saphyre.</hi> But to proceed further in this my Anſwere. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that <hi>Christ</hi> had ſaid in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Words: <hi>The Wombe, that bare me is not bleſſed, neither the Paps, which I did ſuck; but they are bleſſed, who do heare the Word of God, and keep it.</hi> Admit, I ſay, ſo much for the tyme, yet could neither <hi>Caluin,</hi> nor you from hence infer, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> denyed that, which the <hi>Woman</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For do we not thus read (<hi>Oſe.</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.) <hi>Miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam volo, non ſacrificium: I will, or expect Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> and yet it cannot be neceſſarily deduced from theſe words, that <hi>God</hi> would not haue <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> but only, rather leſſe to haue it, then, <hi>Mercy</hi> In like ſort, it is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3016:91"/>ſaid (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.) <hi>Non estis vos, qui loquimini, ſed &amp;c. It is not you that ſpeake, but the ſpirit of your Father, which ſpeaketh in you:</hi> Yet we cannot from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Apoſtles did not ſpeake; but that it was rather the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſpake in them, by way of ſuggeſting, what they were to ſpeake. Thus in ſuch kind of ſpeaches, that which ſeemes abſolutely to be denyed, is not denyed, but only in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or compariſon of ſome other thing. Now from theſe premiſſes it followeth, that <hi>Christ</hi> in the former words, was ſo far from denying, that the wombe was bleſſed, which did beare him, as that he rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſame, as <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Theophilactus (in Comment.)</hi> and alſo <hi>S.

               <p>The knot of this your diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is eaſely looſed. And firſt, if the words by you alledged, were ſo ſtrictly to be taken, as you pretend, then ſhould <hi>S.

               <p>Secondly, euen Reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth the contrary to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3016:93"/>your Aſſertion: For how can any Man be induced otherwiſe to belieue, that ſince S. <hi>Mary</hi> is the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Redeemer of the World, S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> only the <hi>Precurſour</hi> of the Redeemer of the World, but that the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhould be ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then <hi>S.

               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, I ſay, that (as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> doth teach) <hi>S.

Do not then you Papiſts equall her in

               <p>This your Cloud of Errour is eaſely diſſipated and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Firſt, I ſay, How many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities ſoeuer are kept by the Church in honour of our B. Lady, they all (though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally reſting in the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Virgin) are by the mediation of her, terminated in Chriſt; And therefore they may be truly and vertually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the feaſts and ſolemnities of Chriſt, ſince they are inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in honour of the B. Virgin, only (and not otherwiſe) as ſhe is the Mother of Chriſt, our Redeemer. Thus (for example) the Honour exhibited to any great fauorite of a Prince, may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3016:95"/>be iuſtly ſaid to be giuen to the Prince himſelfe; ſince the true Cauſe of the exhibition of the Honour, is the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, which the Prince beareth to ſuch a Worthy Perſonage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere, that if theſe ſeuerall ſolemnities of our B. Lady may not iuſtly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly be obſerued; then hath the whole Church of God fouly erred (and this for many ages together) both for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and practiſe of them; And ſuch as you are, <hi>(Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix)</hi> only hould the truth in impugning of them; the groſſenes of which conceite to apprehend, I refer to any man, enioying but his fiue ſenſes.</p>

And were it not, I am loath to expatiate further in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, then the particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect now diſputed off, would well ſuffer, I could eaſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue your argument drawne from the authority &amp; cuſtome of the Vniuerſall Church.

               <p>I will ſatisfy your motion. But before, I muſt tell you, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3016:96"/>I do not labour to beare you downe (as your phraze is) with a ſtreame of many impertinent Words. No, for I acknowledge that an ouercharge of needles words, is but ſmoake of ſpeach. But to haſten to the ſeuerall feaſts of the immaculate <hi>Virgin.</hi> I will begin with the feaſt of her <hi>Natiuity,</hi> then of the <hi>Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> next of her <hi>Purification,</hi> &amp; laſtly, of her <hi>Aſſumption</hi> into Heauen.

               <p>Now touching the feaſt of the <hi>Natiuity</hi> of our <hi>Blaſſed Virgin,</hi> which falleth vpon the eight day of <hi>September;</hi> Yf we will take into our conſideration, who ſhe is (whoſe Natiuity we

               <p>The Catholike Church at the inſtitution of this feaſt, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that the faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould make a ſolemne Proceſſion.

               <p>Touching the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of our B. <hi>Lady,</hi> two things are chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to be weighed. The firſt, is the certainty of her <hi>Aſſumption;</hi> which all Sectaries with open mouth deny, as you <hi>(Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix)</hi> did in your late <hi>Sermon</hi> againſt the B. <hi>

                  </gap> infoulded her reuerently in white liunen, and layed the Body vpon a Bere, and carrved it vnto <hi>Gethſamini,</hi> with great
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3016:104"/>ſolemnity of the Apoſtles, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; other deuout Perſons, and there made a Graue, in which the Body was layd.</p>
               <p>The foreſaid S. <hi>Damaſcone</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth, that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> (the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) came three dayes after her interring, and hauing a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deſire to ſee the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in regard of his abſence at her death, intreated the other Apoſtles to open the Graue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that he might ſee the dead Body, and do honour and reuerence vnto it. At his requeſt they opened the Graue, but fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there no Body at all, but only the linnen, within which, the ſaid ſacred Body was infoulded, and withall perceaued a moſt ſweet ſauour and ſmell in the ſame place. Vpon the wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnexpected fight wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the Apoſtles concluded,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3016:104"/>that our Lord, who had taken fleſh of Her, would grant her the Honour of riſing, before the day of the Reſurrection; and that ſhe ſhould as well in Body, as in Soule, preſently aſcend vp to Heauen. I will add hereto, what <hi>Iunenall,</hi> the foreſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſayth; to wit, That this ſtupendious Wonder was not ſeene by the Apoſtles only, but alſo by <hi>Timothy Bishop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita;</hi> both of them being Diſciples of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and both being preſent thereat; as alſo by <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus;</hi> and diuers others Saints, witneſſes thereof.</p>
               <p>Theſe Premiſſes are the ground, whereupon the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church reſteth for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the B. Virgins <hi>Aſſumption</hi> into Heauen both in ſoule and Body, before the Common day
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3016:105"/>of the Reſurrection. And to the former proofes I may adioyne theſe following. The <hi>Centurists</hi> do witneſſe (<hi>Cent.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>col.</hi> 1127.) that <hi>S. Austin</hi> did write a Booke, entituling it, <hi>De Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptione <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginis mariae.</hi> The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of which doctrine was ſo anciently receaued, that the <hi>Emperour Mauritius</hi> (more then a thouſand yeares ſince) cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a feſtiuall day thereof, as <hi>Nicephorus l.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 28. recordeth. Yea the certainty of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is further proued from the authority of <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> in a notable Sermon, ſtyled, <hi>De festo Aſſumptionis Mariae,</hi> though ſome others aſcribe it to <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> in tyme his equall. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great Antiquity of which Feaſt, we fynd <hi>Dretſerus</hi> (the Proteſtant) to reprehend Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> herein, thus ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3016:105"/>(<hi>de festis diebus. p.</hi> 148.) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus ordayned the feast of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Mary, in the yeare of Christ, three hundred, ſixty foure, with an vngodly Vſe, that thereby Honour might be giuen vnto Her, and Prayers offered vp &amp;c.</hi> Thus this Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>But I will conclude this point with one moſt conuincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, taken from <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> who thus diſputeth hereof: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath diſcouered and reuealed the Bodies of many Saints (which lay hid in diuers places) that they might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored of faithfull Chriſtians; it then ineuitably followeth, that if the ſacred Body of the <hi>Bleſsed Virgin</hi> had beene ſtill on earth, he would in like manner haue made knowne, no doubt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n what place, or Countrey it did lye: For it not being certainly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3016:106"/>knowne, where that Body or any part thereof is in any place of the World, allthough there be found and knowne ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of her garments; it may be irrepliably concluded, that her Body is not to be found in earth, but only in Heauen. And this is <hi>S. Bernards</hi> demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Point.</p>
               <p>Thus much in proofe of the certainty of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of the B. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Mary</hi> Now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once granted, that her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was aſſumpted vp to Heauen, how much reaſon hath the Church to record her <hi>Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> by inſtituting thereof an yearly feaſt; And to read in that her Honour, <hi>Hodie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I will conclude this Point, only ſaying, that if moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries do yearely obſerue, with honour, the day of the <hi>Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Prince; May not then we Chriſtians keep with a more ſpeciall Solemnity the tyme, when the B. <hi>

               <p>Thus far (<hi>Mariamastix,</hi> and the reſt of you Auditours here preſent) for the iuſtifying of the Catholiks their keeping all the former foure yearely feaſts, and ſolemnities of the B. Virgin.</p>

               <p>Well, to let all this paſſe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the former feaſts, as i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (if not too much) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of; I would haue you

I haue further obſerued, how in moſt great Townes, the chiefe Church is dedicated to <hi>Mary;</hi> whereas all Churches are to be dedicated to <hi>God</hi> alone. And therfore it ſeemes Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to performe that worſhip to Mary, which ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to <hi>God</hi> alone.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3016:108"/>you haue ſeene in Catholike Countries, exhibited to the Image or Picture of the Bleſſed Virgin, I can but grieue to ſee, how Ignorance is masked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the veyle of Satyricall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; and that the ſhew of Reaſon ſhould produce in Man, the Effects of the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore, though the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Point toucheth vpon a new Queſtion, to wit, the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping</hi> of <hi>Images;</hi> Yet for your Inſtruction (though it ſeemes you can hardly brooke this word) obſerue what the Cartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church teacheth therein. <hi>First,</hi> it teacheth, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not done to the Image, as it is wood, or ſtone, or the like, but it is done to the Saint, whoſe Image it is, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof the Honour is ſo transferred. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3016:109"/>do teach, that ſo far forth, as concernes exteriour Acts of worſhip, it is not eaſy to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſeuerall kinds of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; of which ſome kind is due only to <hi>God,</hi> other to Saintes, and Men. For almoſt all exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Acts are common to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of adoration and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, excepting <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is peculiar only to <hi>God.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording hereto we fynd, that <hi>Abraham</hi> with the ſame exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Act of bowing his body to the ground, did adore <hi>God, Geneſis</hi> 17. did adore the <hi>Angells, Geneſ.</hi> 18. and did adore <hi>Men, Geneſ.</hi> 23. Therefore to apply this: Where you ſay, that you haue ſeene diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs to kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Image of our B. Lady, or to put their hat off, as they paſſed by the Image; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, that they giue the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3016:109"/>ſame Honour either to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or to the <hi>Virgin</hi> herſelfe, which is due to God. For we ſee, the Subiect kneeles to his Prince, the Sonne to his Father, and yet the Honour giuen to the Prince by his Subiect, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that, which is giuen to the Parent, by the Child. Thus much to take away this your ſtumbling Blocke; ſince (as is ſaid) not the externall Act of worſhip, but the different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Acts of the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Will, conſiſting in a different apprehenſion of the worth and dignity of him, to whom the Honour is giuen, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Honour due to God alone, from that which is giuen to Saints, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And therefore <hi>S. Thomas</hi> truly teacheth, (2. 2. <hi>quaest.</hi> 103. <hi>art.</hi> 3.) <hi>That there are ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall

               <p>In like ſort, in the yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit, 1555. When one of the Fathers of the <hi>Society of Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:3016:121"/>was preaching to the People, in the Church of <hi>Loreto,</hi> in the cleere day light, certaine bright fiers, falling downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, reſted vpon the moſt ſacred <hi>Chappel</hi> in the preſence of many People, which preſently by ſpreading more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, went aboue the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled multitude, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently into Heauen, with great admiration and wounder of all the audience. <hi>Raphaell Riera</hi> (a godly and learned Prieſt of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Ieſus</hi>) by chance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent among the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, afterwards did ſet downe this very thing in Writing; and much reioyced (as many others there preſent did) that God had vouchſafed them to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to be witneſſes of ſo great a Miracle. That this was no wayne ſight, the iteration of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3016:121"/>ſame Miracle doth teſtify; for two yeares after, when one of the ſame Fathers (according to to their Cuſtome) was preaching in the Church, to the Canons, and the aſſembled Multitude, ſuddenly in the top of the <hi>Thole,</hi> a heauenly flame (like vnto a Comet, or blazing ſtarre) was perceaued to glitter and ſhine; which falling downe vpon the <hi>Sacred Chappel,</hi> ſtood there a litle whyle; then going towards the multitude, made a gratefull ſhew to all the Audience, much admiring ſo great a Miracle: but by &amp; by turning its courſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way (to wit, towards the Place appointed to heare Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, called the <hi>Paenitentiarie</hi>) it moued vp and downe ouer the Heads of the Prieſts, and them that confeſſed their ſinnes; and finally reſting awhyle ouer

But the Marchants being mad,

               <p>I haue here heard a long and tedious tale. I imagine out of <hi>Amadis de Ganle,</hi> or ſome other ſuch Fabulous Booke. I ſay plainly, I do not belieue neither this laſt recorded Miracle of <hi>Clement,</hi> not any of your former for true. For either <hi>Clement</hi> was not eured at <hi>Montaigue,</hi> or els he was cured by <hi>enchantment of the Diuell,</hi> of whome, one Writer ſayth, <hi>Curaſſe dicuntur, cum deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt laedcre. (Tertull.)</hi> And this anſwere I briefly giue to all the ſuppoſed Miracles by you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

               <speaker>Mariadulus.</speaker>
               <p>I greatly commiſerate (<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamaſtia</hi>) the ſtate of your Soule in deſcending to ſuch poore and needy Euaſions. I will begin with the firſt branch of our Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were. And <hi>First,</hi> if you will giue any credit to Hiſtory, recording matter of fact, you cannot but grant, that theſe few Miracles inſiſted vpon by me (beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ſcores of like Nature, here pretermitted) were truly &amp; really effected. You giue full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch ancient Hiſtories and Records, which relate, How <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> was foure times brought into Subiection by Strangers; To wit; by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> Yf then you will belieue <hi>Holinshead, Stow, or Speed</hi> their
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3016:142"/>Relations thereof, being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from more ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, why then will you not giue the like aſſent to theſe Miracles, and others, regiſtred by Men of Integrity &amp; Vertue; eſpecially ſeing all, or moſt of them are circumſtanced, with the tyme, places, perſons vpon whom they were wrought, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes vnder Oath, not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, and finally with the atteſtations and Seales of moſt celebrious Cityes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> by what pretext of Truth can it be auerred, that theſe former, and many others (here not ſpoken of) were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geryes? Becauſe (forfooth) they tranſcend the ſetled Courſe of Nature. But in ſaying ſo, you may deſcruedly be thought to trench ouer-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in condemning all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, you charge diuers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths, Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Prelates, &amp; infinite mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> if the ſaid Miracles were but inuented, and not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought; Why then did not diuers, for example, liuing at <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:3016:143"/>or in the Low Countryes, (being ſtored with Proteſtants) take exception againſt them? Or why is not <hi>Lipſius</hi> his Treatiſe of the Miracles of <hi>Sicheus,</hi> or <hi>Moutaigue</hi> refuted as falſe, &amp; but coyned? And yet no ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt the ſaid Miracles (ſo far forth, as I know) hath beene vndertaken by any Man, though neuer ſo maleuolent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> or our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Fayth.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the ſecond Part of your former Tergiuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which conſiſts in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that perhaps the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Miracles were truly and really wrought; but wrought only by the Miniſtery and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour of the Diuell, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy. To this, I <hi>First</hi> reply, that in aſcribing theſe, and the like Miracles to the Diuell, you
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3016:143"/>partake therein with the Iewes, condemning the Miracles of our Sauiour in theſe words: <hi>Hic non eijcit daemonia, miſi in Belſebub prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe daemoniorum.</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the preſtigious and ſeeming Works of the Diuel in this kind, are euer done to ſome vayne and pernicious end, and not for the good of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon, vpon whom they are wrought, as the Miracles aboue recounted are; as to giue fight to the blynd, hearing to the deafe, ſtrength and agility of body, to the lame &amp; impotent, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> if the Diuell be able to effect ſuch ſtupendious works, how chanceth it, that he would neuer concurre with condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; on all ſides acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miſcreants or Hereticks, in ſeeking to ſtrengthen, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
